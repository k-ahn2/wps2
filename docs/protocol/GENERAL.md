## Type c - Connect

Simply, type `c` is a bi-directional exchange of headers between client and server.

This is the first data exchange after connect - the client sends a type `c` object to the server with information to explain the client state, which is mainly based around timestamps of messages and posts. 

The server then returns a type `c` object with information including the new message and post counts. 

But, a type `c` object also triggers the subsequenct sequence of packets required to update the client with all changes since last login. See [The Connect Sequence Explained](#the-connect-sequence-explained) for a detailed explanation

## The Connect Sequence Explained

### Overview
The type `c` handling is the most complex in WPS - it triggers the chain of responses required to update the client with all changes that have occurred since last login. 

This is the first data exchange after connect - the client sends a type `c` object to the server. The server uses this data to determine the client state and which messages, posts and/or other updates to return.

### Existing Connect - Last Message Timestamp > 0
<hr>
This covers users that have already registered and have data on the client.


Upon receipt, WPS returns:
1. A type `c` object sent to the client, containing:
   - the new message and post counts by channel, even if zero
   - whether there is a version upgrade
2. as required:
   - new messages, sent in batches of 4 as type `mb`
   - new message emojis, sent in one batch as type `memb`
   - new message edits, sent in one batch as type `medb`
   - new posts, sent in batches of 4 as type `cpb`
   - new post emojis, sent in one batch as type `cpemb`
   - new post edits, sent in one batch as type `cpedb`
   - updated last seen times and name changes as type `u`, for Messaged users
   - updated name changes as type `he`, for Channel users
   - online users as type `o`

The connect processing ensures data is only returned once. For example, if a user connects with a last message timestamp of `1740299150`, it will return:
1. any edits, emojis added and emojis removed for messages already on the client (on or before `1740299150`)
2. all new messages after `1740299150`, which already includes the latest edit and/or emojis

Post handling follows the same logic, by channel subscribed

### New User or New Browser - Last Message Timestamp = 0
<hr>
This covers both scenario where there is no data on the client, either because a) the user has just registered for the first time, or c) the user has connected in a new browser.


For a new user, WPS returns
1. A type `c` object sent to the client, containing:
   - new message counts (because they could have messages waiting)
   - a welcome flag set, of this is the first time the user has connected
   - whether there is a version upgrade
2. New messages, sent individually as type `m`

For an existing user connecting with new browser, WPS returns
1. A type `c` object sent to the client, containing:
   - new message counts (because they could have messages waiting)
   - whether there is a version upgrade
2. All recipients the user has ever communicated with, sent to repopulate the recipient list in the browser, sent as type `u`
3. The last 10 messages exchanged with each recipient, sent in batches of 10 as type `mb`

> [!NOTE]
> There is currently no way to recover every message ever sent if a user connects from a new browser. WPS will implement a method for handling this in future
